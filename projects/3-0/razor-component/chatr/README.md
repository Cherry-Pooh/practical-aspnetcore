# SignalR broadcast

This sample attempts to demonstrate on how to use SignalR in your own Razor App. Still a work in progress. Everthing mostly works except that the UI doesn't update on two windows by themselves yet (you have to trigger the UI update manually).

Run the sample on `ChatR.Server` using `dotnet watch`.
