# ELSA Workflow (2)

ELSA is a workflow engine for .NET Core. It is a library that can be used to build workflow applications. It is also a standalone application that can be used to run workflows.

It is included in this ASP.NET Core samples repository because I believe that a workflow engine can play a very substiantial role in the future of ASP.NET Core applications.

- [WriteLine Activity](writeline-activity)
    
    This sample demonstrates a very simple workflow Activity that writes a line to the console.

## Workflow

- [Workflow-1](workflow-1)

    This sample demonstrates a very basic custom workflow.
