# LinkGenerator - Generate path from a route name inferred from the method name

Use `LinkGenerator.GetPathByName` to generate path from a route name. If the method names are available, they will be inferred as route names.

What happens if there are multiple methods with the same name?

**Route name is case sensitive!**
