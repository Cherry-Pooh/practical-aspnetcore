# Wiki

**Note**. This sample uses preview features of C# 9 that is only available on .NET 5 SDK Preview 7. Since this preview has not been released yet, download it from the nightly build [here](https://github.com/dotnet/installer).

This is a Single File Application (SFA) that provide wiki functionality.

- It supports markdown
- You can rename pages
- It is stored using LiteDB
- It has a nice markdown editor

All the code is contained within `Program.cs`.

Please be noted that SFA is a very limited approach in web system development. It is really fun for quick hacking but as of now, there is a lot of nice functionality such as Model Binding that is not available for this style of development.
