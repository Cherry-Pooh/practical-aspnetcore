# Single File Application

Single File Application (SFA) is software written in just a single file `Program.cs` and the project file. We will be using the latest version of .NET 5, ASP.NET Core 5 and C# 9. We will be using C# 9 top level statements extensively.

This style of development is not necessarily the best way to organize your code in production but it is **fun** to write small web apps this way.
