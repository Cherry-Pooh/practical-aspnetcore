# Microsoft Orleans

These are simple samples to play with [Microsoft Orleans](https://github.com/dotnet/orleans).

This section is very early in development. My experience in using an Actor framework is ZERO. Welcome to the world of Grains and Silo.

The order to create a simple Orleans project looks like:

- Create the Interfaces
- Create the Grains
- Create the Silo
- Create the Client

- [Hello World](hello-world)

  This sample is a sample from Orleans that I simplify and port to C# 9.
